# Steganography

"Steganography" project involves the design and implementation of a custom steganographic algorithm as a practical assignment for the "Computer Forensics" course.

## Steps:

- RSA key generation (server/client)
- Diffie-Hellman key exchange (server/client)
- Choose secret message (server)
- Encrypt the secret message using the AES-CTR decryption algorithm with the exchanged symmetric key (server)
- Conceal the encrypted message within the carrier using a steganography algorithm (server)
- Carrier exchange (server/client)
- Extract the encrypted message from the carrier using a reverse steganography algorithm (client)
- Decrypt the secret message using the AES-CTR decryption algorithm with the exchanged symmetric key (client)
